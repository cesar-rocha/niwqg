# niwqg
Code for a special class of solutions of the Xie & Vanneste (2015) coupled model
 –– the documentation is in the works.

# Installation
This software is written in *python3* and depends on *numpy* and *h5py*. I strongly
recommend the python3 pre-packaged on [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).

## Obtaining niwqg
Download or clone niwqg repository.

## Installing
Inside the root niwqg directory, install the package

    python3 setup.py install

If you plan to make changes to the code, then setup the development mode

    python3 setup.py develop
